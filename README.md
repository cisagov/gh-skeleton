[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/gh-skeleton/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/gh-skeleton/actions)

This is a generic skeleton project that can be used to quickly get a
new [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov) GitHub project started.
This skeleton project contains [licensing information](LICENSE), as
well as [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) and
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configurations
appropriate for the major languages that we use.

In many cases you will instead want to use one of the more specific
skeleton projects derived from this one.

## New Repositories from a Skeleton ##

Please see our [Project Setup guide](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/tree/develop/project_setup)
for step-by-step instructions on how to start a new repository from
a skeleton. This will save you time and effort when configuring a
new repository!
